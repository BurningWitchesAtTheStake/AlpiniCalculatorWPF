# Coffee Blend Calculator

At work, we have a client who regularly orders various coffee blends. Since the composition and quantities can change multiple times a day, manual calculations for each variation became too time-consuming. 
To streamline this process, I developed a Coffee Blend Calculator that quickly provides precise proportions without tedious manual computations.

This started as my pet project while learning C#—a simple console application that could only calculate one blend at a time.

Over time, I evolved it into a full-fledged WPF application with a user-friendly interface and advanced functionality.

### Key Features:

- **Proportion Calculation** – Automatically computes ingredient quantities.
- **Batch Splitting** – Evenly distributes blends into manageable portions.
- **Print Results** – Generates ready-to-use data for production.
- **Customizable Configs** – Adjust and save blend parameters for future use.
